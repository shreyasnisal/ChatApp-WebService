# ChatApp-WebService

This repository contains the web-service for the Chat-App. Check the [Chat-App repository](https://github.com/shreyasnisal/Chat-App) for use.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

maven

MySQL

### Installing

Create a MySQL database named *messagesdb*. Create two tables in this database, *users_table* and *messages_table* using the following commands:
`create table users_table(user varchar(100), password varchar(100));`
and
`create table messages_table(message varchar(1000), sender varchar(100), recipient varchar(100));`

In src\main\java\com\app\chatapp\rest, open the RestService.java file and enter your MySQL user and password where mentioned.

Navigate to the project root directory and run `mvn clean install`

Start the web-service using `mvn jetty:run`

## Running the tests

The web-service would be running at the port mentioned in the terminal (default 8093).
To test the web-service, open your browser and use the url:
> localhost:8093/chatapp/isReady

You should get a response *ready*. The web-service is now ready to be used.

## Deployment

### Using the web-service from same machine
To use the web-service from the same machine, use the below url followed by the method to be called:
> localhost:8093/chatapp/

### Using the web-service from a different machine
To use the web-service from a different machine, make sure the client machine and machine running the web-service are on the same network. Then use the below url followed by the method to be called (where server-ip is the ip address of the server machine):
> server-ip:8093/chatapp/

Note: In case of windows user, the firewall on the server machine must be turned off to allow client machines to acceess the web-service.
